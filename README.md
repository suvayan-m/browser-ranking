# Project browser ranking

## What is this project all about?

Concerned about your online privacy? [PrivacyTests.org](https://privacytests.org/) has run extensive tests on popular web browsers to evaluate how well they protect your data. However, their results aren’t immediately easy to interpret—it's hard to tell which browser truly excels at a glance. So, I took their raw JSON data and built a scoring system to rank each browser based on how many privacy tests they passed.
