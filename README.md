#  Project browser ranking

##  What is this project all about?
Are you worried about your online privacy? [PrivacyTests.org](https://privacytests.org/) has done some privacy tests on some of the most popular web browsers. But taking a glance at their website you cannot say which browser has passed the majority of the tests and scored the highest so I took their JSON and wrote some logic to give each browser a score.
